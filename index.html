    <h1>How can you help your dog avoid burns from hot surfaces during summer? Take a look!</h1>
   
   
    <h2>How does the temperature of the ground affect dogs?</h2>
   
    <p id="paragraph-1">Have you ever walked barefoot during summer? Or put your hand on the pavement? You probably noticed that it was really hot, or maybe that it burned your hand. </p>
    <p id="paragraph-2">Dogs can feel this too, when you take them for walks when it’s hot out, and they walk on surfaces like pavement or artificial grass. There is a huge difference in temperature between the air temperature and pavement temperature. So while dogs have an air temperature limit of about 76-85 (depending on the dog, smaller dogs are closer to the ground and experience more heat), it’s good to keep in mind the fact that the pavement dogs often walk on is much hotter.</p>
    <p id="paragraph-3">Dogs’ paws don’t have anything protecting them from the heat of the sidewalk. For example, 86 degrees for the air temperature is about 136 degrees for pavement. This can cause symptoms such as blisters, discoloration, and/or peeling on their paws, or cause them to limp, and not want to walk or have their paws touched. This can be painful for dogs, and could possibly lead to an infection.</p>
   
    <h2>What can you do to prevent/ solve this problem?</h2>
   
    <p id="paragraph-4">If you think your dog might have burned paws, run their paws under cool but not cold water for 10 minutes for a short term solution, and take your dog to the vet.
</p>
    <p id="paragraph-5">To prevent burns on pavement, walk your dog in the grass and in the shade. If that’s not an option, you can put boots on your dog, to protect your dog from the heat. A cheaper and easier solution is to just walk your dog early or late in the day, during morning or evening, and check the pavement temperature before a walk. Keep in mind that things other than heat can cause burns, such as ice, salt used in winter to get rid of ice, and harsh chemicals.
